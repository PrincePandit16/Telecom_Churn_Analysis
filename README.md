## Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical problem for telecom companies, impacting revenue and growth. This project aims to analyze customer behavior, identify churn patterns, and build a predictive model using machine learning techniques.

The analysis includes:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Predictive modeling
- Model evaluation and optimization
