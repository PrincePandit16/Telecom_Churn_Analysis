## Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical problem for telecom companies, impacting revenue and growth. This project aims to analyze customer behavior, identify churn patterns, and build a predictive model using machine learning techniques.

The analysis includes:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Predictive modeling
- Model evaluation and optimization

---

## Dataset

The dataset contains detailed information about 6,418 telecom customers, including their demographic details, service usage, billing information, and churn status.

### Key Dataset Features

1. **Demographics**:
   - Gender
   - Age
   - Married
   - State
2. **Service Details**:
   - Phone\_Service, Multiple\_Lines
   - Internet\_Service, Internet\_Type
   - Online\_Security, Online\_Backup, Device\_Protection\_Plan
   - Streaming\_TV, Streaming\_Movies, Streaming\_Music
3. **Billing Information**:
   - Monthly\_Charge
   - Total\_Charges
   - Payment\_Method
4. **Churn Details**:
   - Customer\_Status (Stayed, Churned)
   - Churn\_Category (e.g., Competitor, Dissatisfaction)
   - Churn\_Reason (e.g., Network reliability, Pricing issues)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/telecom-churn-analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd telecom-churn-analysis
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage

1. Run the Jupyter Notebook to explore the analysis:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Telecom_Churn_Analysis.ipynb
   ```
2. Adjust the code or add new features based on your requirements.

## Results

- The final model achieved **X% accuracy** with **Y% precision** and **Z% recall**.
- Key insights from the analysis include:
  - High churn rates among customers with low tenure.
  - Churn correlates strongly with high monthly charges.
